          What started as another variant showing up across the world is now responsible for 70% of the COVID-19 cases in the
          United States. Now, two new variants of Omicron known as BA.2.12 and BA.2.12.1 have appeared in the U.S.
          So what does this mean for us?
        </p>

        <p class="news">
          It seems that cases will start to rise again, but we should not panic, says Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The emergence of
          this new subvariant in European countries has been cause for worry as coronavirus waves in Europe have long proven to predict a surge in the U.S..
          For now, many health officials predict an increase in cases for the U.S., but say it will not be equivalent to the previous peaks we’ve seen before.
          “If we are going to see an uptick, we should start seeing it within the next week or so,” Fauci said Tuesday, March 22.
        </p>

        <p class="news">
          Since then, we’ve seen new cases rise from a seven day average of 29,090 to 36,687. Although the weekly average for new cases in the U.S.
          has gone up, the trends are unalike those of the previous spikes. For the near future be sure to take the necessary precautions in keeping yourself
          safe as this could be the last rise in COVID-19 we see for a long time.

          The first covid case was identified in December 2019, by December 11, 2020 the first vaccine (Pfizer) received emergency use authorization from the
          Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Creating a vaccine in less than a year was an incredible task, but a task like this being accomplished in only a year?
          Some people had their doubts about the vaccine when it first came out, which led to vaccine hesitancy and the development of alternative medications.

        <h2>What drugs are available?</h2>

        <h3>Anti-inflammatory drugs</h3>
        <p class="news">
          If your immune system cannot deal with the virus quickly, inflammation can become a serious issue and eventually damage vital organs like the lungs and
          lead to death. Many anti-inflammatory drugs have been used before COVID-19 and have been used to treat it since the beginning of the pandemic.
        </p>

        <ul class="news">
          <li>Dexamethasone was the first drug proved to save the lives of Covid patients. It has been given out to seriously ill patients with breathing issues
            and has cuts the rist of death by a fifth for patients on oxygen, and by a thrid for those on ventilators</li>
          <li>Other steroids like hydrocortisone and baricitinib have been shown to work, which are normally used in treatment for rheumatoid arthritis(stiffness
            and loss of function in joints</li>
          <li>Advanced anti-inflammatory drugs like tocilizumab and sarilumab have been used around the world in China, India, and Australia. But are up to 100
            times as expensive as dexamethasone</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="news">

        </p>

        <h3>Anti-viral drugs</h3>
        <p class="news">
          An anti-viral drug targets the ability of a virus to make copies of itself. This keeps virus levels low so our imune system has an easier time dealing with it.
        </p>
        <ul class="news">
          <li>Paxlovid is a pill made by Pfizer that is taken twice daily for five days. It cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by 89% in vunerable adults</li>
          <li>Molnupiravir stops the virus from making effective copies of itself. The manufacturer, Merck, estimates it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="news">

        </p>

        <h3>Antibody therapy</h3>
        <p class="news">
          When attacked by a virus the body makes its own antibodies that will mark the virus for destruction by the bodies immune system. An effective but expensive treatment known
          as monoclonal antibody therapy takes laboratory-produced molecules that act as substitute antibodies that can restore, enhance, or mimic the immune system's response to cells.
        </p>
        <ul class="news">
          <li>Ronapreve, by Regeneron and Roche, reduces the length of hospital stays and the risk of death</li>
          <li>Sotrovimab, by GSK, reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death by 79% in high-risk adults</li>
        </ul>


        <p class="news">
          Although it may seem like progress has slown down towards the Coronavirus, resarchers around the world are still looking into alternative treatments and
          solutions for new variants that could arise.

        <h1>China's COVID pet policy</h1>

        <p class="news">
          In the continous pursuit for a zero-COVID nation, China has issued a policy to have all indoor pets belonging to COVID-19 patients killed.
          Recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ThatsInsane/comments/u0fxgd/pets_filled_up_in_bags_for_their_duly_execution/" target="_blank"> videos</a> have
          surfaced from Shanghai China where pets were collected in netted bags and placed on the streets, waiting to be carried off to their execution.
        </p>

        <p class="news">
          This isn't the first time we've heard of this. Back in March of 2022 there was a neighborhood in the Anci district
          of Langfang city that was ordered to complete a cull of all indoor animals of coronavirus patients. According to the United States
          Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; pets can get COVID-19 from humans, but the risk of pets spreading the disease to people
          was "low". It is still not clear how many animals have been killed.
