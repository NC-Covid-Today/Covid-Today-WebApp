      <p class="about">Covid Today is a web-app created by Sam Prewitt and Chase Allison for our CS-4800 capstone project at 
        Appalachian State University. Our goal is to help share information about the Covid-19 pandemic in an 
        easy to understand way. North Carolina does have a <a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard" target="_blank"> Covid Dashboard</a>,  
        however this site is more focused towards people in healthcare and lawmakers, rather than the average person.
