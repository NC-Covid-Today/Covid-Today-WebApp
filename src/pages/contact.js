      <h1>China's COVID pet policy</h1>

        In the continous pursuit for a zero-COVID nation, China has issued a policy to have all indoor pets belonging
        to COVID-19 patients killed. Recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ThatsInsane/comments/u0fxgd/pets_filled_up_in_bags_for_their_duly_execution/" target="_blank"> videos</a>  
         have surfaced from Shanghai China where pets were collected in netted bags and placed on the streets, waiting to be carried off to their execution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't the first time we've heard of this. Back in March of 2022 there was a neighborhood in the Anci district
        of Langfang city that was ordered to complete a cull of all indoor animals of coronavirus patients. According to the United States 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; pets can get COVID-19 from humans, but the risk of pets spreading the disease to people 
        was "low". It is still not clear how many animals have been killed.

      The first covid case was identified in December 2019, by December 11, 2020 the first vaccine (Pfizer) received emergency use authorization from the 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Creating a vaccine in less than a year was an incredible task, but a task like this being accomplished in only a year? 
      Some people had their doubts about the vaccine when it first came out, which led to vaccine hesitancy and the development of alternative medications. 
      </p>
      <h2>What drugs are available?</h2>
    
        <h3>Anti-inflammatory drugs</h3>
        <p>
        If your immune system cannot deal with the virus quickly, inflammation can become a serious issue and eventually damage vital organs like the lungs and 
        lead to death. Many anti-inflammatory drugs have been used before COVID-19 and have been used to treat it since the beginning of the pandemic.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dexamethasone was the first drug proved to save the lives of Covid patients. It has been given out to seriously ill patients with breathing issues
            and has cuts the rist of death by a fifth for patients on oxygen, and by a thrid for those on ventilators</li>
          <li>Other steroids like hydrocortisone and baricitinib have been shown to work, which are normally used in treatment for rheumatoid arthritis(stiffness 
            and loss of function in joints</li>
          <li>Advanced anti-inflammatory drugs like tocilizumab and sarilumab have been used around the world in China, India, and Australia. But are up to 100 
            times as expensive as dexamethasone</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h3>Anti-viral drugs</h3>
        <p>
        An anti-viral drug targets the ability of a virus to make copies of itself. This keeps virus levels low so our imune system has an easier time dealing with it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Paxlovid is a pill made by Pfizer that is taken twice daily for five days. It cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by 89% in vunerable adults</li>
          <li>Molnupiravir stops the virus from making effective copies of itself. The manufacturer, Merck, estimates it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Antibody therapy</h3>
        <p>
          When attacked by a virus the body makes its own antibodies that will mark the virus for destruction by the bodies immune system. An effective but expensive treatment known 
          as monoclonal antibody therapy takes laboratory-produced molecules that act as substitute antibodies that can restore, enhance, or mimic the immune system's response to cells.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ronapreve, by Regeneron and Roche, reduces the length of hospital stays and the risk of death</li>
          <li>Sotrovimab, by GSK, reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death by 79% in high-risk adults</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
      Although it may seem like progress has slown down towards the Coronavirus, resarchers around the world are still looking into alternative treatments and 
      solutions for new variants that could arise.
