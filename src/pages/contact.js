          In the continous pursuit for a zero-COVID nation, China has issued a policy to have all indoor pets belonging
          to COVID-19 patients killed. Recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ThatsInsane/comments/u0fxgd/pets_filled_up_in_bags_for_their_duly_execution/"> videos </a> 
          have surfaced from Shanghai China where pets were collected in netted bags and placed on the streets,
          waiting to be carried off to their execution.
